# POKESTOP API

This project aims to provide a complete and up-to-date API for Pokemon GO players, whether they want to create a site, an application or anything else. The API uses the GraphQL language.

Pokestop API is currently in the design phase, but you can already start having fun with GraphQL queries. The service is online at `https://pokestop-api-staging.herokuapp.com/graphql` and a [GraphiQL IDE](https://pokestop-api-staging.herokuapp.com/graphiql) is also available.

The game texts are localized in English and French for the moment, but we intend to integrate all other languages quickly.
